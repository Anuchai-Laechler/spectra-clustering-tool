We developed ASPECT to analyse large spectra databases. The heart of the software is a Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) that is able to cluster up to several hundred thousand spectra. The resulting two-dimensional SOM of topologically ordered spectra allows the user to browse and navigate through a huge data pool and helps him to gain a deeper insight into underlying relationships between spectral features and other physical properties.
